                    <h3>30 Miles</h3>
                    <p>Woke up to more inspirational quotes from my grandmother. Started packing up and was invited by a local named Ash to ride with him into Fairfax, a town on the way to San Francisco. Ash guided me through paths avoiding cars, passing houses inspired by "Lord of the Rings" and an abandoned shop called "Rock it Press." Where they used to press posters for grateful dead tours.</p>
                    <p>We reached a diner where Ash was stopping. After parting ways, I headed south towards the Golden Gate Bridge, following bike route signs. Enjoyed plenty of bike paths through towns outside the bay. Had pizza for lunch and continued towards the bridge.</p>
                    <p>Met a biker who recommended a route from San Francisco to LA for an AIDS fundraiser. Climbed a big hill to reach the Golden Gate Bridge, enjoyed the view, and found crossing it a bit nerve-wracking due to wind and sharing space with walkers.</p> 
                    <p>After crossing, a French couple took photos of me with the bridge. Checked into a motel without issues, discussed plans with mom to use an Adventure Cycling route or the AIDS fundraiser route, which I'll upload to my GPS using a public library.</p>    
                    <p>Had dinner at a great burrito place next to the motel and looked forward to exploring San Francisco tomorrow.</p>
