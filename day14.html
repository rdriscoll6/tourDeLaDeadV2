                    <h3>57 Miles</h3>
                    <p>I woke up naturally around 6:20 and had my camping routine down. By 8 AM, I was packed, did some bike maintenance, and had breakfast. Before leaving Brookings, I grabbed some supplies at the dollar store. Enjoying not paying sales tax one last time before entering California.</p>
                    <p>At the state border, I stopped for photos with the sign marking my entry into California. The ride into Crescent City was mostly flat, and I stopped at a taco stand at a farmers' market for lunch. Leaving town, the terrain got hilly, culminating in a daunting 1200 ft climb along Highway 101 with no shoulder. Despite a scare from a passing truck, I made it through and enjoyed some nice downhill stretches with beautiful California beaches in view.</p>      
                    <p>My goal was Elk Prairie Campground. Feeling tired after a slight uphill for 3 miles, I reached the state park only to find the campground 7 miles further. Starting with a 1.5 mile uphill climb, I then enjoyed 5.5 miles of downhill through magnificent redwoods, capturing videos and photos along the way.</p>    
                    <p>At the campground, which charged only $5 for hiker-bikers, I set up camp near a field where elk grazed. After setting up, I went to the ranger station to call my mom. She reminded me it was my 5th consecutive day camping and suggested I find a motel soon for laundry. Agreeing with her, I said goodnight and turned in.</p>
