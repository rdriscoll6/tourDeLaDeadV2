                    <h3>60 miles</h3>
                    <p>I woke up at 6:30 and had breakfast at IHOP. I also withdrew cash from the ATM, knowing it would be the last Chase Bank until San Francisco. Grabbed some food from a gas station for the ride. </p>
                    <p>Leaving Eureka, I enjoyed the bike paths but found the town rundown with many homeless and drug users. Had to briefly ride on the freeway before switching to back roads, which were better but still rough and hilly.</p>
                    <p>Joined Highway 101 briefly but soon turned onto the Avenue of the Giants. This scenic road through the redwoods was stunning, likely the most famous part of the forest. Arrived at a state park where I camped for $5 under the redwoods. After setting up, I cooked soup, explored a nearby trail, took photos, and listened to music before calling it a night.</p>
