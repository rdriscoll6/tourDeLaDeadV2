                <h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
                <p>This was my first bike tour, and I wouldn't have changed a thing about it. Although my initial goal was to reach Denver, I realized that I wasn't meant to recreate my dad's trip—I was meant to have my own adventure. My friend Andrew made a good point: even though my friend left after a week, if he hadn't agreed to come along, I probably wouldn't have done a bike tour at all. As my Polish friend Michalina said, "Maybe there's a reason you were supposed to do this trip alone. Some adventures are meant to be done solo." She was absolutely right.</p>
                <p>I learned a lot about myself throughout all those miles alone. I discovered that I am pretty resourceful, particularly when my friend left early and my GPS broke. I managed to control my emotions and quickly come up with solutions. I hate to admit it, but I think I developed this skill at the office job I worked before the trip.</p>     
                <p>I also found new confidence because of this journey. I realized I could accomplish more on my own than I had previously thought possible. This trip has ignited a hunger in me to try things that will challenge me and make me a better person. The challenges we don't face become our limits. In retrospect, some of the worst days of riding were the highlights of my trip. I had to dig deep, and it felt incredibly rewarding when I completed those tough days. I also gained confidence, knowing I could handle future challenges because of what I'd already overcome.</a>
                <p>I have a greater appreciation for the people in my life, too. Without my mother, family, and friends, I wouldn't have made it as far as I did. Initially, I was focused on the end goal of reaching my destination. But I quickly realized that the destination didn't matter as much as the journey to get there.</p>
                <p>I'm afraid that now I'm back home, I'll fall back into the boring 9-5 routine I was caught up in before. Thanks to this trip, I know I can do so much more, and there's so much more to learn and see. Ultimately, that's the end goal: to see how much we can grow on this Earth. Deep down, I know I'll look back on this trip with fond memories, knowing it was the event that kickstarted me toward becoming the person I want to be.</p>
                <p>The conversations I had with my father regarding his trip now hold a deeper meaning. At first, I thought he wanted me to do a trip with the end destination, for him. Now, looking at it, he wanted me to do this trip because he knew how much his trip positively changed him and how it would have that impact on me too. I know he’d be proud of how I overcame adversity. This trip was not only a personal achievement but also a way to honor his legacy.</p>
