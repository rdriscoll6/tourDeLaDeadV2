                    <h3>60 Miles</h3>
                    <p>Got up early to beat Father's Day traffic, starting my climb about two miles from the camp around 8:30 AM. Kept pedaling until 10:30 AM without checking my phone. Legs felt okay, but the weight on my bike meant I had to pedal hard in high gear. Climbed straight through for my dad on Father's Day, but just when I thought I was done, a surprise 1.5-mile uphill appeared. </p>
                    <p>Reached the peak and enjoyed a shaded, safe ride with my mirror and rear blinker for the next 15 miles to the coast. Met some older women from Western NY in a van exploring America. Lots of rolling hills along the coast—I stopped for a burger at Jenny’s Giant Burgers in Fort Bragg around 1:30 PM, 14 miles from my destination.</p>
                    <p>Decided to stay at the park rather than push on to the next one 27 miles away. Paid $10 to camp, stocked up on groceries, talked to mom, then called it a night.</p>
