                    <p>I woke up and left the campgrounds around 8:40. Like yesterday, the terrain was very flat with nice bike paths, some of which ran alongside the 101 for a while. As I reached Ventura, I realized my phone was almost dead. The X-Games were in town, and I managed to snap a picture of the event sign. I also scored a free Jartos soda as they were sponsoring the event. After a quick recharge at IHOP for brunch, I stocked up on food at Big Lots before hitting the road again.</p>
                    <p>Continuing onward, I arrived in Oxnard, which had good bike paths and was less touristy than Ventura. The landscape started to shift towards more desert-like surroundings as I ventured further out. I passed numerous fields growing sod, which struck me as fascinating since it's something we take for granted in New York.</p>
                    <p>Before joining Route 1 to follow the Malibu route, I stopped by an outdoor exhibit near the Naval Base. My plan was to stay at a campground right in the heart of Malibu. I hadn't realized Malibu is like its own county in California. The roads here are notorious for cars parking along the shoulder to access the beaches, making it quite dangerous. Luckily, my mirror helped me keep an eye on traffic behind me. The terrain remained fairly flat as I made my way to the campground.</p>      
                    <p>Upon arriving, I found the park to be quite upscale. The attendant mentioned that each campsite came with its own WiFi, which was a nice touch. There were many LA hipsters enjoying "glamping" setups. I spoke with my cousin Rachael, who lives just outside Long Beach; she kindly offered for me to crash on her couch tomorrow night. I was excited about seeing her, as it had been since Christmas since we last met. Before turning in, I caught up with some family and friends back home.</p>
