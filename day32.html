                    <h3>65 Miles</h3>
                    <p>I woke up early and had breakfast with my cousin and her kids. We watched a popular kids show called Bluey while we ate. Before leaving, I made sure to get a selfie with my cousin's family</p>
                    <p>Setting off, the first town I passed through was Huntington, known as the birthplace of skateboarding. The bike path along the ocean was nice, although dodging pedestrians could be a bit annoying at times. My goal for the day was to reach San Clemente, about 22 miles away, where I planned to treat myself to In-N-Out Burger. After making it there, I decided to book a motel in Oceanside since there weren't any hiker-biker campsites nearby.</p>
                    <p>Continuing on, the route started to get more remote. I reached a state park hosted by the Marines, where the end of the path was blocked off with a sign warning not to trespass on government property. Despite the warning, my GPS indicated this was the correct route, so I cautiously continued for the next 7 miles, pedaling like Lance Armstrong to get through this stretch.</p>      
                    <p>The bike paths looked brand new, and seeing another cyclist reassured me that I was on the right track. Eventually, I had to ride 7 miles on Highway 5 to reach Oceanside. It was a busy four-lane freeway, but thankfully, there was a decent shoulder. Someone even kindly offered me a ride, but I politely declined.</p> 
                    <p>As I approached the motel, I saw a promotional poster for an Eslabon Armado concert, reminding me how close I was getting to Mexico. After checking in, I called my mother to discuss her flight into San Diego tomorrow. I indulged in In-N-Out Burger again and picked up some candy from a nearby supermarket to celebrate my progress. Reflecting on how far I've come, I felt a mix of excitement and anticipation to reunite with my mom tomorrow.</p>
