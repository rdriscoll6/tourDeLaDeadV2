                    <h3>70 Miles</h3>
                    <p>I woke up this morning around 7:45 at the motel in Paso Robles. Kevin, my Warm Showers host from last night, confirmed I had a place to stay if I could make it to San Luis Obispo. Leaving the motel around 10 AM, I headed south, eager to return to the cooler coast. The detour route forced me 30 miles west, but I didn't mind as long as it kept me away from cars and out of the hot inland section.</p>
                    <p>The first 20 miles involved a lot of climbing, which was a bit annoying, but eventually, I hit a descent with a 6 percent grade for 5 miles. Before that, a sign indicated the peak elevation was 1770 feet. Reaching Highway 1 again, I continued towards the first town, Cayucos. Moving onward, I arrived at Morro Bay. With about 20 miles left to San Luis Obispo and a nice tailwind, I pressed on eagerly.</p>
                    <p>San Luis Obispo turned out to be beautiful, home to Cal Poly Tech. I finally reached Kevin and Jo's house, my hosts for the night, who greeted me warmly. They were exceptional hosts, providing a bed, taking me out to dinner, and treating me to ice cream. Over dinner, we shared stories about their own bike tours and discussed the journey I was currently on.</p>      
                    <p>After dinner, they introduced me to a helpful website called iOverlander, which lists camping spots visited by others. Tomorrow, I'm aiming to make it to Gaviota State Park, which will mean another 70+ mile day. It's a haul, but once I reach Santa Barbara, I'll be in the home stretch of my journey!</p>
