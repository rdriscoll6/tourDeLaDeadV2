                    <p>I woke up a bit slower today, feeling tired, but I packed up and had breakfast. Leaving Elk Prairie Campground, I saw over 20 wild elk in the nearby field, which was amazing. It was foggy, and I wished I had blinkers for my bike lights since the road had no shoulder.</p>
                    <p>Today's ride was full of rolling hills. I passed through Trinidad on back roads to avoid Highway 101. The roads were hilly and rough, but the ocean view was worth it. In McKinleyville, I found a nice bike trail that bypassed the highway. Later, I rode through Arcata on charming back roads surrounded by farms, feeling like I was in a scene from Looney Tunes with Foghorn Leghorn.</p>
                    <p>Arcata itself was a cool college town with a hippie vibe. I grabbed pizza and bought rear blinkers for my bike lights. Feeling the need for a break from camping, I booked a motel in Eureka where I could do laundry next door. Despite stressing a bit about planning my route to San Diego, I reassured myself that things would fall into place.</p>
