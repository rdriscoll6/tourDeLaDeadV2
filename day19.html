                    <h3>70 Miles</h3>
                    <p>Decided last night that today would be a high-mileage day. Got on the road early around 8:20 AM. Rode through rolling hills with farmland on one side and ocean views on the other. About 10 miles in, encountered several one-way traffic stops for road and bridge repairs. Had to wait until it was safe for bikers to pass.</p>
                    <p>Met an older worker who warned me about a steep hill ahead, but I underestimated it. One section was so steep I had to walk my bike. Managed to get through the construction zone without issues. Noticed more fields, the blue ocean, and dried weeds instead of forest trees as I rode further.</p>
                    <p>Stopped for fish tacos after 48 miles and met two German guys, one of whom spoke English. Attempted some German with the other guy who only spoke German; they were riding motorcycles from Alaska to Chile. Told them auf wiedersehen and shortly after met Dan, a bike tourist from Salt Lake City riding a 90's mountain bike like mine, which was encouraging.</p> 
                    <p>The next 20 miles to Stillwater Regional Park went by quickly. Ate mac and cheese for dinner, showered, and settled in for the night. Until tomorrow!</p>
