                    <h3>60 Miles</h3>
                    <p>I woke up around 6:20 this morning with the goal of reaching Port Orford by tonight. The ranger from last night suggested Humbug State Park, so I set off. The first 14 miles took me along rolling hills through a secluded logger back road section before rejoining Highway 101 southbound.</p>
                    <p>Continuing south, I passed through Bandon where I had a fish taco at a small restaurant and bait shop. The landscape was transforming, resembling more of California—no pine trees, just beaches with crystal blue water. During this stretch, I found myself contemplating whether to push all the way to San Diego. It wasn't about impressing anyone but feeling unsatisfied if I ended the trip in San Francisco. </p>
                    <p>I was in the zone and before I knew it, I was just 3 miles from town! Riding on freshly paved roads, I encountered three older cyclists from Montreal, starting their journey from Vancouver to San Diego. We rode together for a bit, stopping to capture photos of a scenic ocean view. After some conversation, I decided to head back into town for dinner before setting up camp.</p>      
                    <p>On my way back towards the state park, my rear bike rack unexpectedly fell off. Upon inspection, I discovered the bolts securing the rack had come loose. Thankfully, I had spare bolts and zip ties for a quick fix. Unfortunately, the mishap caused one of my panniers to fall, ripping the bottom of my bag. Luckily, I had duct tape to patch it up.</p>      
                    <p>Upon arriving at the park, I was a bit tired from dealing with the mechanical issues. I ran into the German father and daughter I met in Tillamook, who directed me to the hiker-biker section. After checking in with the ranger and paying the $8 fee for the night, I called my mom to discuss the idea of continuing down to San Diego. We agreed it would be best to sleep on the decision for a few days, especially since I hadn’t even reached California yet.</p>      
                    <p>As I settled into bed, I wondered if I could make it all the way to San Diego.</p>
