                    <p>My mother dropped me off at the Rochester airport. There, I met up with my friend, and we were able to check in our bikes and boxes filled with panniers and camping gear. We got through TSA without any issues and boarded our connecting flight to Newark. There was no turning back now.</p>
                    <p>After 6 hours, we arrived at the Seattle airport, where we took a shuttle with our check-in items to the hotel we were staying in for the night. We set up the bikes in our hotel room and decided to take the Link into the city to explore Seattle.</p>               
                    <p>We went to downtown Seattle, where we checked out the public market and the waterfront. We got dinner at this place called Ivarâ€™s. After dinner, we took photos in front of the Space Needle. We decided to go back to the hotel to finish setting up our bikes because it was going to be a long day tomorrow. </p>
