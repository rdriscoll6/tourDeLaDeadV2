                    <h3>65 miles</h3>
                    <p>We got up and headed to the bike shop so my friend could get a replacement tube for his flat tire. We talked to the guy at the front desk and fixed the flat in no time. Then we headed to Cathlamet, which was 25 miles from Longview. It was still raining hard and the terrain was hilly, just like yesterday.
                    </p>
                    <p>Once we got to Cathlamet, we decided to push on to Astoria. We took a ferry that crossed the Columbia River, bringing us into Oregon. We had to ride up Route 30, which was mostly hills.</p>
                    <p>When we arrived in Astoria, we found a nice bike path along the river walk and saw some sea lions. Since it was still raining hard, we decided to get another motel, the Atomic Motel. We got some McDonald's for dinner and then went back to the motel. I chatted with my mom and some friends back home before going to bed.</p>
