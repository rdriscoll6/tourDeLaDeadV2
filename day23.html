                    <h3>30 Miles</h3>
                    <p>Got up at 6:40 AM, had breakfast, packed up, and left by 9:20. Today was a shorter ride because there arenâ€™t many stops between San Francisco and Santa Cruz. Half Moon Bay, 30 miles away, was my destination.</p>
                    <p>Leaving San Francisco was pleasant with trails through Golden Gate Park. Once out of the park, I rode along foggy beaches with a strong headwind and encountered massive hills in the suburbs. Back on Highway 1, I had a nice shoulder until Pacific City, where a long uphill awaited with no shoulder. Used my mirror and rear light for safety. </p>
                    <p>Passed through a long tunnel with a good shoulder after the uphill. Arrived in Half Moon Bay sooner than expected. Explored the small, bustling town near Silicon Valley. Returned to the state park, checked into the hiker biker section for $7, spent some time on Instagram, set up camp, had dinner, and then went to bed.</p>
