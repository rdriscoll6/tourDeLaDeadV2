                    <h3>40 Miles</h3>
                    <p>I leisurely got up this morning, taking my time to leave the motel since I only had a short 40-mile ride ahead and check-out wasn't until 11:00 AM. I grabbed some of the complimentary breakfast and enjoyed it in my room. By 10:30, I checked out of the hotel and continued southward.</p>
                    <p>Passing through the beach towns, the first of which was Carlsbad, famous for its skateboarding history, I noticed that the beaches here were slightly different from those in LA. The sand was whiter, and the water appeared slightly bluer. Along the way, I met a cyclist wearing a jersey from the "Old Fart Cycling Club." He shared that 44 years ago, he completed his first bike tour across the western part of the country.</p>      
                    <p>rriving in La Jolla, I encountered some challenging hills, but fortunately, there was a well-designed shoulder for cyclists. After coasting down a nice hill into the busy town of La Jolla, I continued on to Mission Beach, where I saw some cool views of southern California. Along a bike path, I saw a cool dog dressed in a shirt and hat, adding a smile to my day.</p> 
                    <p>Approaching Old Town near the transportation hub, I was surprised by the number of homeless individuals and drug addicts in the area. Despite this, I managed to get a photo in front of the Old Town sign before heading to the hotel where my mother and I were staying.</p>
                    <p>After settling in, I went back down to the lobby to greet my mom when her shuttle from the airport arrived. It was incredibly heartwarming to see her again after such a long journey. We had dinner at a restaurant in Old Town and returned to the hotel to settle in for the night. Tomorrow's destination: the Mexican border near Imperial Beach.</p>
