                    <h3>60 miles</h3>
                    <p>We got up this morning around 5 AM, still adjusted to the NY time zone. We packed up and left Gorst at 6:30. We rode down to Belfair on the Hood Canal, where we saw some beautiful views of mountains, clear water, and trees. We stopped at Mason Lake Park for breakfast.</p>
                    <p>After breakfast, we continued riding along Mason Lake, admiring the nice homes. Eventually, we reached Shelton, a cool little town. I got some Dairy Queen, and then we decided to continue to Elma. We took back roads to avoid Route 101. It was quite rural and reminded me of the northern section of the GTA V map.</p>
                    <p>We stopped at Muggs and Tuggs Tavern to fill up our water bottles. Inside, I saw two paintings of Trump by Jon McNaughton. Politics aside, they were great paintings. As we were leaving, a big guy came out of the convenience store and asked about our trip. I told him our route and where we were from. He told us the Pacific coast is beautiful and once we see it, we’ll want to move out here.</p>  
                    <p>We continued to Elma, which was 13 miles away. We were getting tired from the sun and constant uphills. When we got to Elma, my friend was really exhausted. I talked to a guy in front of the UPS store who told us we could camp at the local park behind one of the ponds and no one would bother us. We got pizza for dinner at a local restaurant, but it wasn’t great. Pizza from the pacfic north west has nothing on New York pizza. We went to the park the guy suggested and set up camp for the night.</p>
