                    <h3>70 Miles</h3>
                    <p>Woke up around 6:45 after a deep sleep. Received inspiring text messages from my grandmother and filtered park water with my Sawyer filter because it wasn't safe to drink. Knew today would be another long day before reaching San Francisco.</p>
                    <p>Encountered lots of rolling hills amid farmland in northern California. Passed through interesting farm towns and faced many one-way traffic ahead signs. Once, a worker told me it was 2-3 miles to the other side while I waited for cars to pass.</p>
                    <p>Had lunch in a small cafe where a 12-year-old was running the register, later saw him watching Fortnite videos on his iPad during his break lol. After lunch, pushed through about 22 miles, passing a mini bay that reminded me of a scene from "Malcolm in the Middle." where Malcolm and Stevieâ€™s family went on Vacation. Reece and Stevie were partying with girls where Malcolm had to fish with Hal.</p> 
                    <p>Rode another 10 miles on moderately hilly roads, where I found a man selling tamales for $3, which I had for dinner. Found a bike path leading to the hiker-biker section of the park.</p>    
                    <p>Met people from San Francisco on day trips, hiking or biking, who shared recommendations for places to visit in the city tomorrow. Hung out with them for two hours around a picnic table before we all went to bed.</p>
