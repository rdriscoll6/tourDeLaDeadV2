                    <h3>25 Miles</h3>
                    <p>I woke up around 6:30 AM, and my mom mentioned she had been up since 3 AM, still adjusting to New York time. I started my day on the bike path where I encountered the stylish dog from yesterday. Most of my ride today was on bike paths until I reached San Diego Bay</p>
                    <p>To cross over to Coronado, I took a ferry across San Diego Bay, enjoying the scenic views along the way. The atmosphere noticeably changed as I moved into a more "wild west" environment. I stopped for lunch at Raising Cane's.</p>      
                    <p>Continuing southward, I could see the border in the distance, passing by some fascinating older cars and entering a more desert-like environment. Approaching Imperial Beach, I encountered horse farms and an unpleasant odor due to signs in front yards protesting a raw sewage spill from Mexico that had been polluting the area.</p> 
                    <p>Following Monument Road, which runs parallel to the border, I arrived at Border Field State Park, only to find it closed due to sewage flooding the roads. It wasn't feasible to continue due to the conditions, with roads covered in nearly two inches of sewage. I took some photos as close to the border as possible before heading back.</p>
                    <p>To return to Old Town, I took a bus and then the trolley, totaling about 90 minutes of travel time. Back at the hotel, my mom and I went grocery shopping at Ralphs. For dinner, we enjoyed In-N-Out before returning to the hotel to rest for the night.</p>
