                    <p>I got up at 7:20 and started to clean up and pack my things. My friend got up a little later. Since it was his last day, we decided not to ride and instead enjoy Newport. We biked back up the huge bridge from yesterday. I was annoyed that we had to go backward, but looking back, my friend was pretty overwhelmed since he had a lot of decisions to make that day.</p>
                    <p>We got breakfast and then went to a park where we hung out for the majority of the day. During that time, I went grocery shopping and took money out of the ATM. My friend got us a motel for the night. Once we got the bikes in the room, I talked to my mother about a possible game plan going forward, and she said family back home supported me as well.</p>
                    <p>We went to dinner at a burger place, which was good and also the cheapest meal weâ€™d had. Then we went to bed, nervous about what this new solo adventure would be like.</p>
