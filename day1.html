                    <h3>40 miles</h3>
                    <p>We woke up this morning and enjoyed the free breakfast at the hotel. After loading up our bikes, we checked out and set off to begin our adventure.</p>
                    <p>Before reaching the ferry, we stopped at Seattle Bike Works to put air in our tires and for my friend to pick up front panniers. On our way to the ferry, we were approached twice by people who noticed we were bike touring. Both had been bike touring before and wanted to give us tips for our journey. They suggested that we use warm showers.</p>
                    <p>Warm showers is an online community where hosts open up their homes to bike tourers. They offer you a warm shower, either a couch, bed, or spot to pitch a tent, and sometimes a meal. Fortunately I already signed up for an account before the trip started. </p>  
                    <p>After that, we boarded the ferry that took us across the water to Bremerton. Bremerton was a cool town with its unique houses and abundant trees, a stark contrast to Western NY. We rode to a town called Gorst, where we got dinner from a gas station and decided to camp in a park just outside of town.</p>
