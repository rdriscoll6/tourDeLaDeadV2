                    <h3>60 Miles</h3>
                    <p>Left Half Moon Bay and rode along a scenic shoulder with occasional longer hills, but they weren’t too tough. Noticed more farms and fewer forests, with great ocean views on my right. Stopped for lunch at Nuevo Ano State Park, known for sea lions, but hiking required a permit, so I explored a trail by the ocean instead, enjoying views and spotting pelicans.</p>
                    <p>Rode 27 miles to New Brighton State Beach, the terrain being extremely flat with strawberry fields and cheap fruit at local farmers markets along the way. Entered Santa Cruz, my first taste of Southern California with palm trees, nice beaches, and charming houses. Enjoyed a relaxed atmosphere, catching a parade of woodie cars on Main Street.</p>
                    <p>Near the campsite, I stumbled upon a street festival with local businesses. Spoke with a highway patrol officer about the route through Big Sur. He was uncertain if I could pass or not, I continued to the state park I was staying at for the night. Saw goats clearing weeds along a closed railroad, learning it’s a method to manage vegetation.</p>      
                    <p>Reached New Brighton State Beach where I got a camp spot for $5. Checked CaliTrac and found out Big Sur was closed, so I'll need an inland detour tomorrow. Set up camp and turned in for the night.</p>
