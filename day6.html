                    <h3>30 miles</h3>
                    <p>We got up this morning and had the free breakfast offered by the motel. We checked out by 10:00 AM. It was immediately clear it was going to be another rainy, windy day. It was also the first day we were riding right along the coast. We took some back roads through the Lewis and Clark National Historical Park.</p>
                    <p>We stopped to get some food, and during this time, my friend mentioned his knee was bothering him. I hope it wonâ€™t be an issue later on. We kept riding, and it was still raining hard. We hit a two-mile downhill stretch that took us to Seaside. Because of the speed we were going, it was windier and the rain felt heavier. My friend and I were soaked.</p>
                    <p>We rode into town and saw the Pacific Ocean for the first time on our journey. We found a diner and had lunch. Given the crappy weather, we decided to get another motel, this time in Cannon Beach. After another hour of biking, we arrived at the motel. I cooked some pasta while my friend went to the laundromat to dry our clothes.</p>
                    <p>After eating, we explored the beach and saw Haystack Rock. We took a bunch of photos, then went back to the motel and settled in for the night.</p>
