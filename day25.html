                    <h3>95 Miles</h3>
                    <p>Today I had to take a detour around Big Sur due to the closure on Highway 1. The roads were mostly flat, passing through numerous farms. Along the way, I spotted a stand selling peaches and bought some for $6. I eventually reached a bike path leading towards the town where the detour began. Given the remote nature indicated on the map, I stopped at a McDonald's to call my mom and let her know about the potential lack of cell service.</p>
                    <p>I rode about 10 miles into the detour and immediately noticed a rise in temperature along with the road becoming bumpy. Unfortunately, my GPS fell off its mount into the lane where a passing white truck knocked it into a field. It took me 20 minutes to retrieve all the parts, but despite my efforts, it wouldn't turn on. This was my primary navigation tool, and although I wasn't upset, I was shocked by what had happened. After riding for another 15 minutes, I found some cell service and called my mom. I explained the situation, and together we managed to share the detour file on Google Maps, getting it working again. However, I realized I'd need to replace my Etrex 22x GPS eventually because I really loved using it.</p>
                    <p>The ride took me through beautiful farm country, although I didn’t stop to take pictures due to good momentum from a tailwind and the need to reach the nearest park 30 miles away. The scenery, with its wineries, reminded me of Tuscany, Italy. I reached Greenfield and opted for McDonald's again for dinner. I decided to push on to King City to spend the night at their county park, despite the slightly hilly 13-mile ride. My phone died along the way, so I had to ask around for directions to the park. Once I found it, I set up camp and went to bed.</p>      
                    <p>While settling in, I heard rustling outside my tent and discovered a guy on a bike. Initially thinking it might be mine, I soon realized it wasn’t. His name was Elijah, and he had also gotten lost on the detour but managed to reach the park around 9 PM. He too began his journey in Washington. I suggested he leave early to avoid having to pay in the morning.</p>
